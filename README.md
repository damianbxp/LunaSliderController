# CNC Gantry Controller with Plant Monitoring

## Description
This Python-based CNC Gantry Controller is designed to control two stepper motors and two servos, primarily used for CNC (Computer Numerical Control) applications. Additionally, a camera is mounted on the end effector of the gantry for observing and monitoring plant growth. The controller provides a versatile platform for precise movement control and plant monitoring in agricultural applications.

## Features
- Control of two stepper motors and two servos for precise movement.
- Integration of a camera for plant monitoring and observation.
- Versatile CNC capabilities for various applications.
- Customizable control parameters for stepper motors and servos.
- Real-time monitoring and feedback for plant growth observation.
- Support for scripting and automation of CNC operations.
